# Maze Screensaver

Various implementations of screensavers employing maze generation for awesome visuals.

Currently present:
- HTML+JavaScript maze generator (works with the Cinnamon Desktop Environment's webkit [screensaver][1])
- The same as above, but draws pixelized images instead of boring white

Planned:
- xscreensaver module
- macOS screensaver
